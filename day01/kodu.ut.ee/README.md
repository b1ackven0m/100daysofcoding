# Python Recap

## Chapter 1: Variables, Strings and Numbers
In this section, you will learn to store information in variables.

## Chapter 2: Lists, Tuples and Sets
In this notebook, you will learn to store more than one value in a single variable.

## Chapter 3: If Statements
In this section, you will learn how to test for certain conditions and respond appropriately to those conditions.

## Chapter 4: Loops and Input
While loops are really useful because they let your program run until a user decides to quit. This section also introduces the first way to get input from your program’s users.

## Chapter 5: Dictionaries (Data Structures)
Dictionaries allow us to store connected bits of information, such as a person’s name and age together.

## Chapter 6: Introducing Functions
Functions reduce the work for programmers, resulting in code that is less error-prone.

## Chapter 7: Classes and OOP
In this section, you will learn about classes, the last major data structure. Classes are flexible and allow you to define the information and behavior that characterize anything you want to model in your program.

## Chapter 8: Exceptions
Exceptions are events that can modify the flow of control through a program. In Python, exceptions are triggered automatically on errors and can be intercepted by your code.

## Appendix: Python Coding Style
As you start writing more substantial Python programs, it's a good time to consider your overall style in writing code.
